<h1 id="main-heading">Sample Paragraphs</h1>
<h2 class="subheading statement">Piranhas are mostly harmless.</h2>
<p class="css-subject">Although most people consider piranhas to be quite dangerous, they are,
    for the most part, entirely harmless. Piranhas rarely feed on large animals;
    they eat smaller fish and aquatic plants.<span>When confronted with humans,</span>
    piranhas’
    first instinct is to flee, not attack. Their fear of humans makes sense.
    Far more piranhas are eaten by people than people are eaten by piranhas. If the fish are
    well-fed, they won’t bite humans.</p>

<h2 class="subheading answer">Where can you find piedmont mountains?</h2>
<p>Piedmont, or mountain, glaciers are found in many parts of the world. In North America
    they are distributed along the mountain ranges of the Pacific Coast from central
    California northward. They abound in the Andes range in South America and are familiar
    and greatly admired spectacles in the Alps, the Pyrenees, the Caucasus Mountains and
    the mountains of Scandanavia. Rivers of ice flow down the valleys of various Asian
    mountain ranges, including the Himalayas, the Hindu Kush, and the Karakoram and Kunlun
    ranges. They are also a feature of the Southern Alps of New Zealand and are found in
    the lofty mountains of New Guinea. The largest piedmont glaciers are the Malaspina and
    Bering glaciers, both in Alaska.</p>

<h2 class="subheading answer">How does high population density affect mice?</h2>
<p>When mice are kept at high population densities, their behaviour changes in a number of
    ways. Aggressive activity within populations of mice rises as density increases.
    Cannibalism of young also goes up, and so does aberrant sexual activity. Communal nesting,
    frequent in natural mouse populations, increases abnormally. In one example, 58 mice one to
    three days old (from several litters) were found in one nest, most unusual communal living.
    None survived because most of the mothers deserted them immediately after birth.</p>

<h2 class="subheading answer">Why does light bend around the vicinity of a black hole?</h2>
<p>Black holes are regions in space-time where gravity's pull is so powerful that not even
    light can escape its grasp. However, while light cannot escape a black hole, its extreme
    gravity warps space around it, which allows light to “echo,” bending around the back of
    the object.</p>

<h2 class="subheading statement">Viruses are the most abundant life on planet Earth.</h2>
<p>Scientists' research has revealed that viruses are by far the most abundant life forms on
    Earth. There are a million times more viruses on the planet than stars in the universe.
    Viruses also harbor the majority of genetic diversity on Earth. Scientists are finding
    evidence of viruses as a planetary force, influencing the global climate and geochemical
    cycles. They have also profoundly shaped the evolution of their hosts. The human genome,
    for example, contains 100,000 segments of virus DNA.</p>
